-0.2 your program does not reverse strings with spaces

You can use string.h for builtin string functions. Instead of manually computing length, you can use strlen(). Good in place algorithm, though recursive algorithms take up stack memory.
In your input function, you can just return a char * instead of passing your char[] as a parameter.
Either put all functions before main or after.
