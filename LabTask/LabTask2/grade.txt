-0.2 no mail directory provided
-0.2 incorrect pam directory
-0.2 incorrect umask code

you can use cp instead of catting the file

-0.1 extract is meant to select that line, not to throw that line away

-0.1 for rename.sh, file extensions must be at the end of a filename
     but your script replaces the pattern even in the middle of a filename

in CSCCodes you can specify matching whole words in grep by using the -w option
-0.1 you should not be using the -v option. 'extract' does not mean delete the matching pattern, but delete everything but the matching pattern.


-0.3 in GrepExInts, your variable name pattern only accepts a small subset of possible variable names.
