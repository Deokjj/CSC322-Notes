<LI> C Basics
     <UL>
     <LI> History of C
          <UL>
          <LI> UNIX developed in 1969 in BCPL - a language for writing 
               compilers and system tools.
          <LI> A new version written in 1970 in B - a cut down version of BCPL
          <LI> A totally new language C  in 1972 - a successor to B
          <LI> By 1973 UNIX almost totally written in C.
          </UL>
     <LI> Characteristics of C
          <UL>
          <LI> Small size
          <LI> Extensive use of function calls
          <LI> Loose typing
          <LI> Structured language
          <LI> No objects
          <LI> Low level (bitwise) programming readily available
          <LI> Pointer implementation - extensive use of pointers for memory, 
               array, structures and functions.
          <LI> Not object oriented (no classes, objects, inheritance, etc.)
          </UL>
     <LI> C has now become a widely used professional language for various 
          reasons.
          <UL>
          <LI> It has high-level constructs.
          <LI> It can handle low-level activities.
          <LI> It produces efficient programs.
          <LI> It can be compiled on a variety of computers.
          </UL>
     <LI> As an extreme example the following C code 
          (<A HREF="MyCode/Mystery.c"><TT>Mystery.c</TT></A>) is 
          actually legal C code.
          <PRE>

          <LI> It will compile and run and produce meaningful output. Try this
               program out. 
          <LI> Clearly nobody ever writes code like or at least should never. 
               This piece of code actually won an international

               C Code Contest</A>.
          </UL>
     <LI> The standard for C programs was originally the features set
          by Brian Kernighan. In order to make the language more 
          internationally acceptable, an international standard was developed,
          ANSI C (American National Standards Institute).

<LI> Getting started
     <PRE>
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include &lt;stdio.h>

int main(void) {

    printf("Hello, world\n");

    return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

     </PRE>
     <UL>
     <LI> The <TT>#include</TT>s include definitions of standard i/o library
          functions and standard odds-and-ends. 
          In general, <TT>#include</TT> includes a file. 
          <UL>
          <LI> Include files end with <TT>.h</TT>.
          <LI> If the file name is enclosed in <TT>&lt;></TT>, the standard 
               include file directories (e.g., <TT>/usr/include</TT> on UNIX 
               systems) are searched for the file. 
          <LI> If enclosed in <TT>""</TT>, the current directory is searched, 
               then the standard include file directories. 
          </UL>
     <LI> A C program consists of one or more functions.
          <UL>
          <LI> Every program must have a <TT>main</TT> function somewhere. 
               Execution starts with the <TT>main</TT> function and ends
               when it returns (other happy endings are possible too :-)
               (and there are some unhappy endings :-().
          <LI> <TT>int</TT> before main indicates that <TT>main</TT> returns an 
               integer value.
          <LI> <TT>()</TT> following the function name surrounds the argument 
               list.
               <TT>void</TT> here indicates that there are no arguments.
          <LI> <TT>{}</TT> enclose the statements that make up the function.
          </UL>
     <LI> C is case sensitive, <TT>main</TT> is not the same as <TT>Main</TT>, 
          etc.
     <LI> <TT>printf</TT> is a general purpose format conversion function. 
          <UL>
          <LI> <TT>printf</TT> is not part of the C language.
          <LI> <TT>printf</TT> calls a standard function that is held in 
               a library and linked in at link time. 
          <LI> <TT>printf</TT> is defined in <TT>stdio.h</TT> for compiler 
               checking. 
          <LI> Its output goes to <TT>stdout</TT>
          <LI> A sequence of characters in <TT>"..."</TT> is called a character 
               string or string constant.
          <LI> <TT>\n</TT> is for newline.
          </UL>
     <LI> The <TT>return</TT> sends the integer value back, via the OS, to
          the parent process.
          <TT>EXIT_SUCCESS</TT> is the standard success return value, and
          <TT>EXIT_FAILURE</TT> is the standard value when something has 
          gone wrong.

<LI> Compiling C
     <UL>
     <LI> By convention the filename must end <TT>.c</TT>, e.g.
          <TT>MyProgram.c</TT>
     <LI> There are many C compilers around.
          <UL>
          <LI> The <TT>cc</TT> is the default compiler.
               Often it's simply an alias for ...
          <LI> The GNU C compiler <TT>gcc</TT> is popular and available
               for many platforms.
          <LI> Other (less common) C compilers exist. 
          <LI> All the compilers operate in essentially the same manner and
               share many common 
               <A HREF="../CTools/Compiler.shtml#Some Useful Compiler Options">
               command line options</A>.
          <LI> The best source of information for each compiler is
               through the online manual pages: e.g., <TT>man gcc</TT>.
          </UL>
     <LI> To compile your program simply invoke the compiler followed by
          the name of the (C) program you wish to compile. E.g.,
          <PRE>
prompt> gcc Program.c </PRE>
     <LI> If there are language errors in your program the compiler
          will detect and report them.
          <UL>
          <LI> The <TT>-Wall</TT> option will make the compiler warn about 
               code that can be compiled but looks dodgy ... use it.
          <LI> The <TT>-ansi</TT> option will raise errors for non-ANSI
               standard constructs.
          <LI> The <TT>-pedantic</TT> option will make the compiler compile
               strictly to ANSI standards ... it's not necessary.
          </UL>
     <LI> The compiled version, or executable, is left in a file called
          <TT>a.out</TT>, or, if the compiler option <TT>-o</TT> is
          used, the file listed after the <TT>-o</TT>.
          <UL>
          <LI> It is convenient to use a <TT>-o</TT> and filename in the
               compilation as in
               <PRE>
prompt> gcc -Wall -o Program Program.c </PRE>
          </UL>
     </UL>
<P>
<LI> Running
     <UL>
     <LI> To run an executable in UNIX, you simply type the name of
          the file containing it, e.g.,
          <PRE>
prompt> a.out
prompt> Program </PRE>
     <LI> This assumes you have <TT>.</TT> in your <TT>path</TT>
          variable. If you don't you have to precede the file name
          with <TT>./</TT> to say "look in the current directory".

          <UL>
          <LI> The condition is tested each time before the body is executed.

               (Style suggestion ... always use  a compound statement).
          </UL>
     <LI> Note the use of indentation, meaningful variable names, etc.
     <LI> The comparison/assignment/subtraction of <TT>float</TT> and 
          <TT>int</TT> is ok, the <TT>int</TT>s are automatically converted 
          to <TT>float</TT> before the comparison/assignment/subtraction 
          occurs.
     <LI> <TT>5.0/9.0</TT> is real division - implied by the constants.

               - Program to copy input to output.
          <LI> Input and output is considered to be a stream of
               characters. A special character is the new line character
               <TT>\n</TT>, which breaks the stream up into lines.
          <LI> <TT>getchar()</TT> returns the next character on <TT>stdin</TT>
               as an integer. e.g. <TT>c=getchar()</TT>. 
               The return value is integer to facilitate the return of 
               <TT>EOF</TT>, which is a symbolic constant defined in
               <TT>stdio.h,</TT> and is often <TT>-1</TT>. 
               Hence <TT>C1</TT> is defined as an integer.
          <LI> From the keyboard <TT>EOF</TT> is generated by a line containing
               <TT>^D</TT>
          <LI> <TT>putchar(C)</TT> prints (portably, the last 7 bits of,
               see <TT>limits.h</TT> for the local width of a char) integer 
               <TT>C</TT> onto <TT>stdout</TT> as a character.
               It also returns an <TT>int</TT> value (see later).
          <LI> Calls to <TT>putchar</TT> and <TT>printf</TT> may be 
               interleaved, the output will appear in same order.
          <LI> <TT>getchar</TT> and <TT>putchar</TT> declarations reside 
               in <TT>stdio.h</TT>.
          <LI> The return value from function <TT>putchar</TT> has been ignored.
               This is always ok.
          <LI> <TT>!=</TT> means not equal to
          <LI> In C any assignment can be used as an expression, its value
               being the value assigned to the LHS.

               with slightly different effects. See later.

               In addition they make sense as false is associated with 0 
               and true with non-0 integers.
               Correspondingly, <TT>int</TT> is used for Boolean variables.
          <LI> The initialisation in one line is possible as assignment
               has a value and associates right to left. i.e.

     <LI> ANSI standard compilers provide prototyping which allows a
          function to be completely (including arguments) declared
          before use, to improve compiler error checking.
          <UL>
          <LI> If not declared a (probably inappropriate) default is used.
          <LI> If the function is defined before use, this will act as a
               declaration. 
               <UL>
               <LI> Thus the functions could be put before <TT>main</TT>,

          <LI> All library functions have their prototypes in the
               appropriate header file, which must be included.
          </UL>
     <LI> A C function can act as a procedure or a function. If the type
          is <TT>void</TT> then no value is returned, and the function 
          acts as a procedure.
          <UL>
          <LI> A value is returned via the <TT>return</TT> statement. 
               If a value is returned the function acts as a true function 
               and is invoked by using the function name as a value.
          <LI> A <TT>return</TT> statement without a value causes control 
               but no value to be returned, as does "falling-off-the-end". 
               In this situation the function acts as a procedure and may be
               invoked via the function name. 
          <LI> Functions that return values may have their return values 
               ignored, and be treated like procedures.
          <LI> A function may have multiple <TT>return</TT>s.

     <LI> Variables declared in a function are local and temporary
          (unless specified otherwise - see later).
     <LI> A C program may be distributed over multiple files, and
          functions called between files. In every case, a function must
          be declared before use.

          - Program with function with arguments
     <LI> In C all function arguments except arrays are passed by value,
          i.e. the arguments are re-created locally when the function is
          invoked and the appropriate values copied from the invokation.
          Thus this version alters <TT>Exponent</TT>, but that does not 
          affect the actual argument in the call.
     <LI> Pass by reference can be achieved by explicitly passing the
          address of (pointer to) a variable.
     <LI> The exception is in the case of arrays where the value passed
          to the function argument is the address of the first element
          of the array. Thus arrays are passed by reference.

     <LI> C represents character strings internally by the sequence of
