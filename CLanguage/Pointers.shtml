<LI> Pointer variables
     <UL>
     <LI> Nothing useful yet, just the idea
     <LI> Pointers to primitive types
          <UL>
          <LI> The definition <TT>int *pi1;</TT> says <TT>pi1</TT> will hold
               the address of an integer, or <TT>*pi1</TT> is an <TT>int</TT>.
          <LI> The unary operator <TT>&</TT> gives the address of an object.
          <LI> The unary operator <TT>*</TT> implements indirection on its
               argument.
          <LI> Assigning pointers to pointers
          <LI> Pointers can be manipulated like other variables, e.g.
               assignment and increment (what does this mean).

          <LI> <TT>NULL</TT> is defined in <TT>stdio.h</TT> as 0.
          <LI> Pointers and <TT>int</TT>s are not interchangable (despite a
               cavalier attitute of classic C programmers).
          <LI> The only integer that may be assigned to or compared with a
               pointer is 0. Using <TT>NULL</TT> makes this explicit.
          <LI> C guarantees no pointer to data will contain 0, so returning
               <TT>NULL</TT> for an error is safe.

     </UL>
<P>
<LI> Pointers and arrays.
     <UL>
     <LI> Pointers and arrays are closely linked in C.
          Anything that can be done with array subscripting can be done
          with pointers.
     <LI> An array name provides the address of the first element of the
          array. e.g. <TT>int A[10];</TT> Then <TT>A == &A[0]</TT> and
          <TT>*A == A[0]</TT>.
     <LI> Given a pointer <TT>PA</TT> into an array <TT>A</TT> (the array
          name counts as a pointer to the first element), then the pointer
          can be indexed like an array.
     <LI> An array name is a constant address and cannot be assigned a
          new value, but a pointer to an array element can.
     <LI> Given a pointer <TT>PA</TT> into an array <TT>A</TT> (the array
          name counts as a pointer to the first element), then adding or
          subtracting an integer gives a pointer offset that far along the
          array.
     <LI> Given two pointers into an array, subtracting them gives the number
          of elements from one to the other.
     <LI> Incrementing or decrementing a pointer (which is pointing into an
          array) moves the pointer along the array
     <LI> <A HREF="MyCode/ArrayPointer.c"><TT>ArrayPointer.c</TT></A>
          - Using pointers into an array
     <LI> Function arguments
          <UL>
          <LI> It is possible to pass part of an array to a function by
               passing the address of the element at the start of the
               required part. e.g. <TT>strlen(&s1[3])</TT>.
          <LI> The receiving function may view the passed address as an
               array (subscripted from 0 again) or as a pointer to an element.
          <LI> <A HREF="MyCode/ArrayRestart.c"><TT>ArrayRestart.c</TT></A>
               - Offsets an array in a function
          </UL>
     <LI> Multi-dimensional array accesses are also converted to pointer
          access.
          <UL>
          <LI> Given the definition <TT>int a[5][8]</TT>,
               <TT>a[3][5]</TT> is converted to <TT>*(*(a+3)+5)</TT> in the
               steps <TT>a[3]</TT> => <TT>*(a+3)</TT>, <TT>a[3][5]</TT> =>
               <TT>*(a+3)[5]</TT> => <TT>*(*(a+3)+5)</TT>.
          <LI> <TT>a</TT> - a pointer to the 1st of 5 arrays of 8 elements.
          <LI> <TT>a+3</TT> - a pointer to the 4th 8 element array.
          <LI> <TT>*(a+3)</TT> - a pointer to the 1st element of the 4th 8
               element array (because the 4th 8 element array is an array!!.
               If it were a number it would be the number).
          <LI> <TT>*(a+3)+5)</TT> - a pointer to the 6th element of the 4th 8
               element array.
          <LI> <TT>*(*(a+3)+5)</TT> - the 6th element of the 4th 8 element
               array.
          </UL>
     <LI> Pointer arithmetic on addresses in different arrays is
          dangerous as order of memory allocation is not consistent
          between compilers. No pointer arithmetic other than that
          described here should be used.
     </UL>

<P>
<LI> Character pointers and functions.
     <UL>
     <LI> String constants and arrays of <TT>char</TT> are implemented
          the same.
     <LI> When a character string (or any array) is passed to a
          function, a pointer to the start of the string is actually
          passed. The end of a string is marked with a <TT>\0</TT>.
     <LI> The definitions
          <PRE>
char message[] = "Hello world";
char *message = "Hello world";
char *message;
message="Hello world";
          </PRE>
          are different. The first defines an array, the second and
          third a pointer to a string, somewhere where the compiler puts
          it.
          Take care that you own the memory that you use
     <LI> <A HREF="MyCode/StringPointers.c"><TT>StringPointers.c</TT></A>
          - Dangerous games with strings
     <LI> C does not provide string manipulation directly, but there are
          plenty of library routines, declared in <TT>string.h</TT> and
          <TT>stdlib.h</TT>.
     </UL>

<P>
<LI> Arrays of pointers and arrays of arrays
     <UL>
     <LI> This works neatly because array names are pointers, so a
          pointer can be assigned an array, e.g. sorting arrays of
          strings into order can be done by swapping pointers to the
          strings, rather than swapping the strings themselves.
     <LI> Useful for ragged right edge arrays.
     <LI> <A HREF="MyCode/StringsSort.c"><TT>StringsSort.c</TT></A>
          - Sorting strings by pointers
          <UL>
          <LI> <TT>Name</TT> is an array of pointers to character.
          <LI> Each of these characters is the first in an initialised array.
               (Pointer to a character is also a character array).
          <LI> The characters of the ith string are stored somewhere and a
               pointer to them is stored in <TT>Name[i]</TT>.
          <LI> The size of name is given implicitly by the number of
               strings in the initialisation.
          </UL>
     <LI> Pointers vs Multi-dimensional arrays
          <UL>
          <LI> <TT>int A[10][10], *B[10];</TT> defines <TT>A</TT> to be a 2D
               array of 100 <TT>int</TT>s and <TT>B</TT> to be an array of 10
               pointers to <TT>int</TT>.
          <LI> <TT>A[4][6]</TT> and <TT>B[4][6]</TT> are both syntactically
               legal. <TT>A[4][6]</TT> is the 7th element in the 5th array.
               <TT>B[4][6]</TT> is the memory location 6 <TT>int</TT>s beyond
               the address given in the 5th array element, equivalent to
               <TT>*(B[4] + 6)</TT>.
               If <TT>B[4]</TT> points to an array of ints of length >=7
               the two are equivalent.
          <LI> The setting up of <TT>B</TT> to point to arrays is the
               programmer's responsibility.
               The setting up of <TT>A</TT> to the 10 x 10 format is
               the compiler's responsibility.
          </UL>

<P>
<LI> Pointers to functions.
     <UL>
     <LI> Pointers to functions can be passed to functions.
     <LI> <A HREF="MyCode/SortByFunction.c"><TT>SortByFunction.c</TT></A>
          - Program demonstrating passing functions as parameters.
     <LI> As <TT>CompareGreater</TT> and <TT>CompareLess</TT> are
          defined (declared) before <TT>main</TT>, they are known to be
          functions of type <TT>int</TT>, and the compiler will pass
          their addresses to sort. (For functions addresses are passed,
          like arrays.)
     <LI> The declaration <TT>int (*CompareFunction)(int,int)</TT> says
          <TT>CompareFunction</TT> is a pointer to a function of type
          <TT>int</TT> and takes two <TT>int</TT> arguments.
          <UL>
          <LI> The <TT>()</TT> are necessary round <TT>(*CompareFunction)</TT>
               as <TT>(int,int)</TT> takes precedence over <TT>*</TT>.
          <LI> <TT>int *F(int,int)</TT> declares a function
               that returns a pointer to an <TT>int</TT>.
          <LI> <TT>int *(*F)(int,int)</TT> declares a pointer to a
               function that returns a pointer to an <TT>int</TT>.
          </UL>
     <LI> The call <TT>(*CompareFunction)(Data[Index],Data[Index+1])</TT>
          is consistent with the declaration.
          <UL>
          <LI> <TT>*CompareFunction</TT> is a pointer to a function
          <LI> <TT>CompareFunction</TT> is a function.
          <LI> The <TT>()</TT> are needed to provide the correct associations.
          </UL>
     <LI> These pointer declarations can get confusing, due to the use
          of <TT>()</TT> for indicating functions, and indicating precedence.
          <UL>
          <LI> In precedence <TT>()</TT> = <TT>[]</TT> > <TT>*</TT>
          <LI> <TT>()</TT> and <TT>[]</TT> have left to right associativity,
               <TT>*</TT> has right to left associativity.
          <LI> Try these examples, using precedence and associativity to
               justify the types :
               <UL>
               <LI> <TT>char **PPC;</TT> - <TT>PPC</TT> is pointer to a
                    pointer to <TT>char</TT>.
               <LI> <TT>int (*Table)[13];</TT> - <TT>Table</TT> is a pointer
                    to an array of 13 <TT>int</TT>s.
               <LI> <TT>int *Table[13];</TT> - <TT>Table</TT> is an array of
                    13 pointers to <TT>int</TT>.
               <LI> <TT>void *F(void);</TT> - <TT>F</TT> is a
                    function that returns a pointer to <TT>void</TT>, and
                    takes no arguments.
               <LI> <TT>void (*F)(char);</TT> - <TT>F</TT> is
                    a pointer to a function that returns a <TT>void</TT>, and
                    takes a <TT>char</TT> argument.
               <LI> <TT>char (*(*F(void))[])(int,int);</TT> - <TT>F</TT>
                    is a function of no arguments returning a pointer to an
                    array of pointers to functions that return <TT>char</TT>
                    and have two <TT>int</TT> arguments.
               <LI> <TT>char (*(*A[])(float))[5];</TT> - <TT>A</TT> is an
                    array of pointers to functions that return pointers to
                    arrays of 5 <TT>char</TT>, and take one <TT>float</TT>
                    argument.
               </UL>
          </UL>
     <LI> The <TT>qsort</TT> standard library function is very useful function
          that is designed to sort an array by a key value of any type into
          ascending order, as long as the elements of the array are of fixed
          type.
          <UL>
          <LI> <TT>qsort</TT> is prototyped in <TT>stdlib.h</TT>:
               <PRE>
void qsort(void *base, size_t num_elements, size_t element_size,
   int (*compare)(void const *, void  const *));
               </PRE>
          <LI> The argument <TT>base</TT> points to the array to be sorted,
               <TT>num_elements</TT> indicates how long the array is,
               <TT>element_size</TT> is the size in bytes of each array
               element and the final argument <TT>compare</TT> is a pointer to
               a function.
          <LI> <TT>qsort</TT> calls the <TT>compare</TT> function which is user
               defined to compare the data when sorting. <TT>qsort</TT> thus
               maintains it's data type independence by giving the comparison
               responsibility to the user.
          <LI> The <TT>compare</TT> function must return integer values
               according to the comparison result:
               <UL>
               <LI> less than zero : if first value is less than the second
                    value
               <LI> zero : if first value is equal to the second value
               <LI> greater than zero : if first value is greater than the
                    second value
               </UL>
          <LI> Some quite complicated data structures can be sorted in this

<LI> Write a code segment that declares an array of 10 pointers to
     <TT>int</TT>, initializes all of them to point at the <TT>int</TT>
     variable <TT>anInt</TT>, and finally prints out the contents of
     <TT>anInt</TT> using the 5th array element.
<LI> What is the output from the following code?
     <PRE>
char Name[12];
char *Offset;

strcpy(Name,"Sutcliffe");
Offset = &Name[4];
printf("%s\n",Offset);
     </PRE>
<LI> Write a code segment that declares a pointer to a float, and then
     makes the pointer be the "name" of a newly created array of 10 floats.
<LI> Write a pointer version of the <TT>void squeeze(char *s1,char *s2)</TT>
     function, that deletes each character in <TT>s1</TT> that matches a
     character in <TT>s2</TT>.
<LI> Write an improved <TT>dispose_heap_frame</TT> function
     <TT>char *dispose_heap_frame(char *frame,int size)</TT> that checks
     that frame does extend to the top of the heap, returning <TT>frame</TT>
     if successful, <TT>NULL</TT> if an error occurs.
<LI> Improve the sorting example given by writing a <TT>choose_direction</TT>
     function that returns a pointer to one of <TT>compare_greater</TT> and
     <TT>compare_less</TT>, depending on whether the user inputs an
     <TT>A</TT> or not. The if-then-else construct in the main function can
     then be replaced by :
     <TT>sort(data,number_of_numbers,choose_direction());</TT>.
<LI> Write a C program to read through an array of any type using pointers.
     Write a C program to scan through this array to find a particular value.
<LI> An insertion sort is performed by adding values to an array one by one.
     The first value is simply stored at the beginning of the array.
     Each subsequent value is added by finding its ordered position in the
     array, moving data as needed to accommodate the value and inserting
     the value in this position.
     Write a function called insort that performs this task and behaves in the
     same manner as qsort, i.e it can sort an array by a key value of any type
     and it has similar prototyping.
